# Cyclistic_Share_Case_Study
This is a case study of cyclistic share, a company renting bicycles, from google data analytics

This case study is conducted according to 6 phases of data analysis: Ask, Prepare, Process, Analyze, Share, Act
The data is from https://divvy-tripdata.s3.amazonaws.com/index.html.
The question to solve by analysis is "How do annual riders and casual riders use this service differently?"
I use Pandas for data processing and preparation and R for analysis and visualization.
A whole data analysis process is on Cyclistic_Share_Case_Sttudy.ipynb.
To run the code properly, please extract Trip_Dataset.zip file and move Trip_Dataset file into your working directory or the cloned repository.
